# Day 19: Welcome to React - Building Your First Component

This project is part of the **MERN Stack Ascent Challenge**.  
It demonstrates the **fundamentals of React** by building a simple **Header component** using JSX and rendering it to the DOM with a single HTML file setup (via CDN).

---

## Challenge Overview
Create a single HTML file that demonstrates React's core concepts by building a simple `Header` component that displays your **name** and **professional title**.

- **Component Architecture**: Breaking UI into reusable, self-contained components
- **JSX Syntax**: Writing HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript
- **Virtual DOM**: How React efficiently updates the browser DOM
- **Declarative Programming**: Focus on describing what you want, not how to do it

### Technical Skills
- **Single-File Setup**: CDN-based React environment (no build tools required)
- **Functional Components**: Modern React component patterns
- **JSX Expressions**: Dynamic content rendering inside JSX
- **ReactDOM Rendering**: Connecting React components to the DOM
