# Day 20: Props & Reusability - Building Reusable React Components

This project is part of the **MERN Stack Ascent Challenge**.  
It demonstrates **React Props and component reusability** by creating a reusable `<ProjectCard>` component that can display different project information dynamically.

---

## Challenge Overview
Create a reusable `<ProjectCard>` React component that accepts `title` and `description` as props, then use it multiple times in your `App` component with different project data to demonstrate **component reusability**.

### Technical Skills
- Functional components with props  
- Rendering multiple instances of the same component with different data  
- Passing props in JSX  
- Best practices for creating reusable and flexible components
