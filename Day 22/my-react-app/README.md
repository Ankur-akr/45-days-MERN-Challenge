# React Challenge: Rendering Lists with `.map()`

### Day 22: Rendering Lists Challenge

This project is a solution to the "Day 22: Rendering Lists Challenge" from the MERN Stack Ascent, focusing on mastering React's list rendering capabilities.

The core of this challenge involves transforming an array of data into a dynamic list of React components, ensuring optimal performance using the `key` prop.

### ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Objectives

* **Array Mapping**: Use the JavaScript `.map()` method to transform an array of data into a list of React components.
* **Key Prop**: Understand and implement the `key` prop to provide a unique identifier for each component in a list, which is essential for React's reconciliation process and performance.
* **Dynamic Rendering**: Create a list that automatically updates when the underlying data changes in the component's state.
* **State Management**: Use the `useState` hook to manage the array of project data.
* **Component Composition**: Build a reusable `ProjectCard` component that can display information for a single project, promoting a clean and modular code structure.
