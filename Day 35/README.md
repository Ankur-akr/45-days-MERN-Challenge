# Day 35 - React UI: Skills & Contact Section

This project is part of my **MERN Stack Ascent Challenge (Day 35)** — focused on building the **Skills** and **Contact** sections of a React-based resume application.

## 🚀 Overview

This mini React project demonstrates:
- Displaying dynamic data in React using arrays and `.map()`.
- Building reusable UI components.
- Designing a responsive Contact Form UI (without backend logic yet).

## 🧩 Components

const skills = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"];
Renders each skill inside styled tags using .map().

A simple UI-only form that includes:

Name, Email, Subject, and Message fields.
